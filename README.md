# personal dotfiles for my machines

## machines:

- desktop: desktop
- macbook: macbook
- umbra: vm profile _(see todo)_

## TODO:

- [x] continue to be as indecisive as possible
- [ ] rename random variables in functions in config just to be confusing
- [ ] vm profile
- [ ] find replacement for horrid recursiveMerge in libs.nix

## functions _~stolen~_ taken from sodiboos config at github.com:sodiboo/system:

- readDirRecursive(ly) in libs.nix
- other functions in libs.nix may be derived from other concepts
- fileSystems and fs.type in modules/hardware.nix
